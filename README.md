* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Application is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Utilization of Node and MySQL
to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
